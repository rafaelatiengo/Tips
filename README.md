  <summary> Google Earth Engine and Artificial Intelligence (AI): A Comprehensive Review</summary>
📄 In this article, the authors provided a systematic review of relevant literature to identify recent research that incorporates AI methods in GEE.
Then, they discuss some of the major challenges of integrating GEE and AI and identify several priorities for future research.

🟢 Here are some important points and info from the paper that I would like to highlight:

➡️ About 25 PB of data are being generated per day at Google, a significant portion of which is spatio-temporal data.

➡️ The primary applications that have applied GEE integrated with AI are crop, LULC, vegetation, wetland, water, and forest.

➡️ Land cover classification is the 2nd-most-developed domain area using GEE and AI, followed by forest and deforestation monitoring.

➡️ The primary study areas are China, Brazil and USA.

➡️ The most-used remote sensing data types are Landsat 8 OLI, Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+.

➡️ Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Classification and Regression Tree are the most popular Machine Learning models.

➡️ The top evaluation metrics used are: overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy and Kappa.

➡️ SAR imagery is often used in water mapping of flood monitoring analyses because of its ability to see through clouds and work over spatial scales.

⚠️ GEE compute limits:

➡️  Authors often ran into memory errors when analyzing too many field samples/observations.

➡️  This also happened when the size of the author's input data was too large more generally and it was difficult to know beforehand if intermediate processing steps would trigger this error.

➡️  Many authors had to export data as part of their analysis to access functionality not on GEE or because using GEE would make them run out of the amount of free compute provided. For example, every image uploaded to GEE is limited to 10 GB. As the authors used subcentimeter drone imagery, they had to downsize each image before uploading it, resulting in a loss of resolution.
